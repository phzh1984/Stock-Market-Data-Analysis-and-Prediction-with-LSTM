# Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-with-LSTM

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores and analyzes time series data from the stock market, with a focus on technology stocks such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The notebook demonstrates various aspects of data manipulation, visualization, risk assessment, and attempts to predict future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

About Time Series Data

Time series data is a series of data points indexed in chronological order, making it essential for data analysts and data scientists. The analysis in this notebook provides insights into historical stock performance and potential future trends.

Key Questions Explored

Throughout the notebook, we address several key questions:

Price Change Over Time: What was the change in the stock price over time?

Average Daily Return: What was the average daily return of the stock?

Moving Averages: What were the moving averages for various stocks?

Correlation Analysis: What was the correlation between different stocks?

Risk Assessment: How much risk is involved in investing in a particular stock?

LSTM Prediction: Can we predict future stock behavior, specifically the closing price of Apple Inc. using LSTM?

Data Source

We retrieve our stock data from the Yahoo Finance website. Yahoo Finance is a valuable resource for financial market data and provides tools to find compelling investments. To access this data, we use the yfinance library, which offers a threaded and Pythonic way to download market data from Yahoo. You can learn more about yfinance in this article.
